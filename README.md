Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify tuberculosis cases based on patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is in CSV format and contains the following:
- **Features**: Various patient attributes such as age, symptoms, test results, etc.
- **Target**: A binary label indicating whether the patient has tuberculosis (1) or not (0).

Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before training the model.
